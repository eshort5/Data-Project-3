	The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation data shows that access to athletic facilities varies throughout the city. The Southeast Bronx has the most facilities per 1,000 residents, while Port Richmond has the least. Several zip codes were omitted from original data provided.

	<i>Linda Byszynski runs The Friends of Mafera park, a volunteer group that maintains and advocates for Mafera Park, in Ridgewood, Queens. She’s spent over five years learning about the funding processes for local parks, and has seen just how the pandemic fueled the need for these spaces.

	“The community has rallied around a cause that is a personal one but important to others as well,'' said Byszynski. “I talked to a lot of the volunteers, and they talked about how important the park became because of the pandemic. It was a refuge away from their apartment or home.”
